## 🎯 What Actually Stood Out

* In real-world business situations — like **choosing a vendor** or **introducing a new policy** — **data visualization directly influences decisions.**
* Strong visualizations have **clarity, visual logic, reduced density,** and a **decision focus.**
* Bad visuals usually fail because they create **high cognitive load, contain too much text,** and use **misleading visuals** that distract instead of inform.
* Great visuals focus on **what supports decision-making**, not decoration. They make insights clear and easy to act on.
* **Design isn’t decoration — it’s direction.** Every design element (color, animation, image) should move the message forward.
* **Less is more.** Clean, simple visuals communicate confidence.
* **Color rules:** stick to one main color and one secondary color. Use them **sparingly, intentionally, and consistently.**
* The key to becoming a **strategic business communicator** is being able to answer two questions:
  1️⃣ Who is the audience?
  2️⃣ What do they hope to take away from this presentation?

## 💡 Discoveries 

* **Highlight outcomes, not processes.** People care about results, not the long journey to the insight.
* **Simplicity beats density.** Short, high-contrast visuals with minimal text drive points home faster.
* **Good visuals strengthen your argument.** Poor ones weaken it, no matter how solid your data is.
* **Design serves content, not ego.** Pretty slides that confuse people are still bad slides.
* **Bottom line:** Great design isn’t about adding more — it’s about **making information make sense.**

## 📊 The Three-Step Storytelling Formula (a.k.a. Data’s Drama Arc)

1️⃣ **Setup** — Introduce the situation or question.
2️⃣ **Conflict** — Present the challenge, anomaly, or insight.
3️⃣ **Resolution** — Show the key takeaway or decision.

💬 *Pro tip:* Separate each phase with clear visuals and descriptive titles. Highlight only what matters and leave the rest out.

## 🧩 5 Quick Fixes for Better Presentation Decks

1. Start with a basic text outline before designing.
2. Time your slides — **1 slide = 30–60 seconds max.**
3. Choose visuals that strengthen your story.
4. Keep text concise and readable — no mini essays.
5. Step into your audience’s shoes — **see what they see.**

## ✨ Key Takeaway

I learned that people are very much interested in my story. Showing up with my whole being and personality  
makes the presentation not only land but stick. That's what gets people to connect.
