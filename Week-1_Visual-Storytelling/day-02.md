## Day 2 - Goal Setting & Externship Intentions

**Date:** November 4, 2025

### 🎯 *Mission: Impress Canva (Like, Seriously)*

**About Today?:**
• Remember that orientation we were supposed to have yesterday? We finally had it today via a live Zoom session! 💃
• Today’s live learning session got real — I officially set my goal for this externship: **get noticed by Canva.**
• Not just a passing glance — I want Canva to look at my work and think, *“We need this person on our team.”*
• Every project I submit will carry that energy. I’m going all in so that when Canva spotlights top projects… mine’s glowing in bold, neon letters.
