**No Spoilers, I promise 😅:**
• Today was all about *doing the thing* — I built my **first visual story in Canva using a metaphor I picked!**
• It wasn’t just about clicking templates and dragging shapes — it was about bringing everything from this week to life:  
clarity, simplicity, and purpose-driven design.  
• Honestly? Seeing the final output made me go, *“Yeah, I did that. Bet you I did!”* 💅

### 💡 Reflection

• Turning lessons into visuals hits different. You start seeing design not as art, but as **communication in motion.**
• This was the first real taste of what it means to tell a story *visually* — and it’s only getting better from here.
