# Day 5 – Visual Hierarchy

**Date:** November 7, 2025

Pretending to be Steve Jobs for a few minutes, lol.

Here's how I'd present the slide in the keynote speech if I were Steve Jobs back in 2007.  
I couldn't sit with the idea of using the image of the iPhone as at 2007. 😭  
No apololgies. 😅

**What I Learned / What Stood Out:**  
• Good design is basically a **clever trap** — it pulls you in before you even realize it.  
• The secret? Three simple steps:  
 1️⃣ **Attract** — Grab attention fast.  
 2️⃣ **Intrigue** — Make them want to stay.  
 3️⃣ **Deliver** — Hit them with the message clearly and confidently.  
• That’s the magic of **visual hierarchy** — guiding the eye, not forcing it.  

**Deep Dive: The Anatomy of Visual Hierarchy**  
• In the **Attract phase**, **size does the heavy lifting** — bigger elements grab attention first.  
• When layering text:  
 - **Main heading:** bold and dominant (your hook).  
 - **Subheading:** semi-bold (your intrigue).  
 - **Body text:** smaller, lighter (your delivery).  
• Think of it like storytelling in typography — every font weight plays a role.  

**Creating Natural Design Pathways**  
• Your layout should follow how the human eye naturally moves: **top → center → bottom**, forming a subtle **Z-shaped path.**  
• This creates rhythm and flow — it’s like leading the viewer by the hand through your design without saying a word.  

**Text & Design Hooks**  
• Every visual should have:  
 - A **hook** (what grabs attention),
 - A **secondary follow-up** (what deepens curiosity),
 - A **finisher** (the call-to-action — “Book a visit,” “Contact us,” etc.).
• That’s your mini-story structure in one slide.  

**The Four Rules of Layout**  
1️⃣ **Use alignment lines — don’t eyeball placements.**  
 Grid lines keep everything clean and intentional.  
2️⃣ **Balance your design.**  
 There are three main types:  
 • **Symmetrical:** evenly weighted on both sides.  
 • **Asymmetrical:** creatively unbalanced but still visually stable.  
 • **Radial:** elements radiate from a central point.  
3️⃣ **Use white space on purpose.**  
 Let your design breathe — clutter kills clarity.  
4️⃣ **Proximity matters.**  
 Group related items together — just like how navigation buttons on a landing page sit close because they belong to the same function.  

**Bottom Line:**  
Visual hierarchy isn’t just about looks — it’s about **leading attention, creating flow, and making meaning obvious** at a glance.
