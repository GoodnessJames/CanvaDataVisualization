### 🗓️ Day 0 – Nov 03  
**Surfing Day: Aka “Testing the waters”** 👀 

- Kicked things off by getting myself familiar with the externship project details.  
- Read about our program manager, **Satya** (seems like someone who means business *and* fun).  
- Got a quick refresher on **Canva** — not a first timer though; I’ve been a fan for ages!  
- Wrapped up with the good ol’ **house rules** to keep everyone grounded and on track.  

That’s basically **Day 0** — calm before the creative storm. 😅
