### 🗓️ Day 0 – Nov 03  
**Orientation Day: Aka “Let’s Get This Party Started”** 🎉  

- Kicked things off with orientation — the warm-up before the real fun begins.  
- Met our program manager, **Satya** (seems like someone who means business *and* fun).  
- Got a quick refresher on **Canva** — not my first rodeo; I’ve been a fan for ages.  
- Wrapped up with the good ol’ **house rules** to keep everyone grounded and on track.  

That’s basically **Day 0** — calm before the creative storm.
